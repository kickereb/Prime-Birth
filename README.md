# Prime Birthdays

## Description
This project generates a list of all prime birthdays that can occur in an input year. A prime birthday is one which, when written as DDMMYYYY format, is a prime number. For example, 30 October 1999 is 30101999.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Replace `'prime1.txt'` and `'prime2.txt'` in the Python script with the paths to your actual files containing the prime numbers.
3. Run the Python script in an environment where Python and pandas are installed and have necessary permissions to read your files.

## Features
- Generates a list of all prime birthdays that can occur in an input year.
- Outputs the list in a pandas DataFrame where each column is a month and each row is a day of the month.
- Calculates the total number of prime birthdays for each Zodiac sign from the year 0000 to 9999.

## Future Work
- Optimize the program to run faster.
- Create an interactive website where users can play around with the variables.
